We had to add quite a bit of functionality to our semantic analyzer to get our project three to work. One of our biggest bug fixes was passing the class table to the type check to get the semant_error() method. Previously we were mistakenly passing semant_error, which was always causing an error (we thought that was how to access the error stream). We had to fix the way we handled SELF_TYPE, namely making sure we saved SELF_TYPE as the type for dispatch if it was the dispatch class (instead of the class used to look up the method). We also implemented functionality for case. We also added bug fixes to how we gather valid classes/parents/methods to make sure basic classes were added properly. Finally, we also had to edit our least_upper_bound function to add the first symbols to the parent lists.
